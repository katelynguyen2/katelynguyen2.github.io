This visualization shows a bar chart of Bigfoot reports grouped by U.S. state. The x axis shows the state names the y axis shows the count of reports. The tooltips displaying both values for more precise readouts. The default categorical color palette works well because each bar represents a distinct state so color is not very important. There were no major data transformations required, the chart uses Vega-Lite’s aggregation function (aggregate: "count") from the dataset. It was interesting to see that Washington had the highest number of reports.
